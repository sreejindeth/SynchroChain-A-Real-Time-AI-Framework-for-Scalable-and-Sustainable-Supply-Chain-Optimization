# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
.python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in a team environment it might be better to use Pipfile only, as Pipfile.lock may
#   cause merge conflicts.
#Pipfile.lock
